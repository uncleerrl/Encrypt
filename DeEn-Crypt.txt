###
####	(ONLY TESTED ON KALI LINUX)
##### 	1-Save as DeEn-Crypt in a location you know the file path-
##### 	2-Open Bash, Terminal, Terminator, or you favorite CLI, navigate to the directory in which ####	DeEn-Crypt is stored with (cd "/home/lostandfound/") replace "/home/lostandfound/" 
###	with the folder "DeEn-Crypt" is stored in. 
##	3-Type "sudo chmod +x DeEn-Crypt"
#	4-Type "./DeEn-Crypt --help" to display options
#	5-To Encrypt Example "./DeEn-Crypt -e [File]"
#	6-Enter Strong Password
#	7-Verify Password
#	8-To Decrypt "./DeEn-Crypt -d [File.aes]"
#	9-Enter in Password to Decrypt
#	10-Decypted File will be in the same folder as the encrypted file.
